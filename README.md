# startup_page
Modification of Tayumpee's web page, added a kanji remembering system. 

This is one of my first tries to create a startup page for my use. 
In this case i used Tayumpe's startup page as a base, then i added a script to 
show randoms kanji and it's meaning. 

Tayumee's startup page:	https://startpages.github.io/startpages/start_page_2-tayumpee/
